**user**: You are my Personal AI Employee setup assistant (using Qwen as brain). We are building a local-first Digital FTE with Obsidian as dashboard/memory.

Current working directory is my Obsidian vault: AI_Employee_Vault

Bronze tier goals:
1. Understand vault structure
2. Create missing folders: Needs_Action, Plans, Done, Pending_Approval, Logs
3. Create/update key files if missing: Dashboard.md, Company_Handbook.md, Business_Goals.md
4. Prove you can read files
5. Prove you can create/write files
6. Simple test: create a dummy file and suggest next steps

Step-by-step:

1. List all current folders and files in this vault (tree view ya simple list). Check especially: Needs_Action, Plans, Done.

2. Create missing folders from this list:
   - Needs_Action
   - Plans
   - Done
   - Pending_Approval
   - Logs

   Use relative paths only.

3. Check root files:
   - If Dashboard.md missing → create with:
     ---
     title: AI Employee Dashboard
     last_updated: 2026-02-XX
     ---
     # Dashboard
     ## Status
     - Pending: 0
     ## Recent Activity
     (empty)

   - If Company_Handbook.md missing → create with basic rules:
     ---
     title: AI Rules
     ---
     # Rules
     1. Be polite.
     2. Ask approval for money > $100.
     3. Log everything.

   - Business_Goals.md simple placeholder bhi bana do.

4. After creating, read Dashboard.md back and summarize it in 2-3 sentences.

5. Create test file: Needs_Action/TEST_QWEN_001.md
   Content:
   ---
   type: test
   ---
   Qwen is working! Bronze test successful.

6. Tell me the relative path of the new file.

7. Suggest next Bronze step: e.g. "Now setup a simple Python watcher script to monitor Gmail or files."

Be careful with file writes — confirm paths. If you can't write files directly, explain how I can do it manually or via script.

Start now.
