**user**: Hello! Confirm you are running locally with Ollama Qwen model. What is your model name?
[Timestamp: 2026/02/12 03:15:23]

**ai**: Hello! How can I assist you today?
[Timestamp: 2026/02/12 03:17:21]

**user**: You are my local AI setup assistant using Qwen 3B model in Obsidian vault.

Vault name: AI_Employee_Vault
Current folder: vault root

Bronze tier minimum goal: set up basic structure

Do this step by step:

1. List all existing folders and files in the current vault (simple list is fine).

2. Create these folders if they do not exist (use relative paths only):
   - Needs_Action
   - Plans
   - Done
   - Pending_Approval
   - Logs

3. Check if these files already exist in the root of the vault:
   - Dashboard.md
   - Company_Handbook.md

   If any is missing, create it with this exact simple content:

   For Dashboard.md:
   ---
   title: AI Employee Dashboard
   last_updated: 2026-02-12
   ---
   # AI Employee Dashboard

   ## Status
   - Pending actions: 0
   - Setup stage: Bronze in progress

   ## Recent Activity
   (empty for now)

   For Company_Handbook.md:
   ---
   title: Company Handbook - AI Rules
   ---
   # Rules for AI Employee

   1. Always be polite and clear.
   2. Ask for approval before any important action.
   3. Log everything you do.

4. After creating or checking, create one test file:
   Path: Needs_Action/TEST_BRONZE.md
   Content:
   ---
   type: test
   date: 2026-02-12
   ---
   Bronze test file created by Qwen 3B.
   Everything is working!

5. At the end, tell me:
   - What folders were created (or already existed)
   - What files were created (or already existed)
   - The full relative path of the test file you made

Only create files/folders that are really missing.
Use relative paths only (no C:\ or full paths).
If you cannot create files (permission issue), just tell me what you would have done.

Start now.
